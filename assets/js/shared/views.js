// A view is applied by putting its query in the address bar and reloading. On a static
// board that costs a few milliseconds and it is the only way to be certain the page is
// showing that selection and not half of it.
//
// Two honest limits, both said out loud in the page rather than only here:
//   · a saved view is kept in this browser. It is not shared, synced or backed up.
//   · the page link already carries the selection, so a link is how you send one.
